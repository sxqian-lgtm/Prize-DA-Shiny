## TidyTuesday Dataset

<https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2025/2025-10-28/readme.md>

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
## install.packages("tidytuesdayR")

tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2025-10-28')
#tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2025, week = 43)

prizes <- tuesdata$prizes

```

```{r}
length(unique(prizes$degree_institution))
```

```{r}
length(unique(prizes$prize_genre))
```

```{r}
length(unique(prizes$prize_alias))
```

```{r}
length(unique(prizes$prize_name))
```

```{r}
length(unique(prizes$prize_id))
```

```{r}
prizes |> count(uk_residence, person_role, ethnicity_macro)

## Deliverable

-   Create a **Shiny app** with an interactive interface that allows users to easily explore the dataset using relevant filters.

-   Your app should include multiple **web pages (tabs)** that address key questions about the dataset. These questions can be based on those discussed in class or ones you develop on your own — bonus points will be awarded for original questions that demonstrate insight or creativity.

-   The app should include **data visualizations** that help communicate your findings clearly.

-   When submitting, please provide a **GitHub repository** containing:

    -   `app.R` (the main file to run the app)

    -   Any additional scripts used in the app

    -   The cleaned dataset

    -   A working version of the app that can be launched directly from `app.R`
